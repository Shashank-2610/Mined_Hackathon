# Reducing desk rejections for researchers (CACTUS).
### Team name : Slytherin Synapsis

**Sponsor** : CACTUS (Paperpal)

**Track Number** : 1


* Many times, researchers get their manuscripts rejected due to the failure of many minor and significant checks, and nearly 30 to 40% get rejected outright even before it is sent for review by peers.

* Our project helps the researchers get their manuscripts checked which reduces the chances of manuscripts getting rejected before it is sent for review by peers.
